const CONSENT_TREATMENT = `INFORMED CONSENT FOR TREATMENT - BT RPN PLLC & Kristina Castro, NP PLLC d/b/a Healing Soulutions
Effective Date: March 15, 2026

I voluntarily consent to healthcare services from the Practice including nursing assessments, IV hydration/vitamin infusion, injections, wound care, post-op care, medication administration, health screenings, phlebotomy, and wellness consultations.

NATURE OF SERVICES: Mobile, concierge, and/or telehealth by licensed RNs and NPs per NY Education Law Article 139. Services are provided in non-traditional settings including private residences, hotels, offices, and other locations designated by the patient. I understand that mobile healthcare delivery may present limitations not present in traditional clinical settings, including but not limited to access to emergency equipment, sterile environments, and immediate physician backup.

RISKS AND COMPLICATIONS: I acknowledge that all medical procedures carry inherent risks. Risks associated with services provided include but are not limited to: pain, bruising, swelling, or infection at IV/injection sites; allergic or anaphylactic reactions to medications, vitamins, supplements, or other administered substances; hematoma, nerve injury, phlebitis, thrombophlebitis, or vascular injury; dizziness, nausea, vomiting, or fainting (vasovagal syncope); air embolism (rare but potentially serious); infiltration or extravasation of IV fluids; fluid overload or electrolyte imbalance; adverse drug reactions or interactions with current medications; cardiac arrhythmia (rare, associated with certain IV therapies); delayed healing or scarring at treatment sites; and unforeseen complications that may require emergency medical intervention. Benefits may include improved hydration, symptom relief, enhanced wellness, and recovery support. No specific outcomes or results are guaranteed.

ASSUMPTION OF RISK: I understand and voluntarily assume all risks associated with the services described herein, including risks that are known, unknown, anticipated, or unanticipated. I acknowledge that the practice of medicine and nursing is not an exact science and that no guarantees have been made to me regarding the outcome of any treatment or procedure.

PEPTIDE THERAPY / NON-FDA APPROVED (IF APPLICABLE): Peptides including but not limited to BPC-157, Thymosin Beta-4, Thymosin Alpha-1, GHK-Cu, KPV, MOTS-c, SS-31 (Elamipretide), DSIP, Epitalon, AOD-9604, CJC-1295, Ipamorelin, Follistatin, and Humanin are NOT approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the specific uses described. These peptides are considered investigational, compounded, or used off-label. They are sourced from licensed U.S. compounding pharmacies operating under applicable state and federal regulations. I understand that: (a) these substances have not undergone the full FDA approval process; (b) their safety, efficacy, and long-term effects have not been established by the FDA for the described uses; (c) I am voluntarily choosing to receive these therapies after being informed of their non-FDA approved status; (d) a mandatory NP consultation is required prior to initiation of any peptide protocol; (e) individual results may vary and are not guaranteed; and (f) I may experience adverse effects that are currently unknown or undocumented.

LIMITATION OF LIABILITY: To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, I agree that the Practice, its owners, officers, employees, contractors, agents, and affiliated clinicians (collectively, the Released Parties) shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages arising from or related to the services provided. The Released Parties' total aggregate liability for any direct damages shall not exceed the total fees paid by me for the specific service giving rise to the claim. This limitation applies regardless of the theory of liability, whether in contract, tort (including negligence), strict liability, or otherwise.

INDEMNIFICATION: I agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the Released Parties from and against any and all claims, damages, losses, liabilities, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising from or related to: (a) my failure to disclose material medical information including but not limited to pre-existing conditions, medications, allergies, substance use, or prior adverse reactions; (b) my failure to follow post-treatment instructions or recommendations provided by the clinician; (c) my use of services against medical advice or after being informed of contraindications; (d) any misrepresentation made by me in connection with the services; or (e) my violation of any term of this agreement.

RELEASE AND WAIVER: I, on behalf of myself, my heirs, executors, administrators, legal representatives, successors, and assigns, hereby release, waive, and forever discharge the Released Parties from any and all claims, demands, actions, causes of action, suits, damages, losses, and expenses of any kind or nature whatsoever, whether known or unknown, which I now have or may hereafter have, arising out of or in connection with the services provided, except to the extent caused by the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Released Parties. I expressly waive any rights I may have under Section 1542 of the California Civil Code or any similar statute of any other jurisdiction which provides that a general release does not extend to claims not known at the time of executing the release.

NO GUARANTEE OF RESULTS: I acknowledge that no guarantees, warranties, or assurances have been made to me regarding the outcome, effectiveness, or results of any treatment, procedure, or service. The Practice expressly disclaims any implied warranties, including but not limited to implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose, to the fullest extent permitted by law.

PATIENT RESPONSIBILITY: I acknowledge my obligation to: (a) provide complete, accurate, and truthful medical history and health information; (b) inform the clinician of all current medications, supplements, and substances used; (c) disclose all known allergies and prior adverse reactions; (d) follow all pre-treatment and post-treatment instructions; (e) seek emergency medical care if I experience any severe or unexpected symptoms following treatment; (f) notify the Practice immediately of any adverse reactions or complications; and (g) attend all recommended follow-up appointments. I understand that failure to comply with these obligations may result in adverse outcomes for which the Practice shall not be held liable.

EMERGENCY AUTHORIZATION: In the event of a medical emergency arising during or after treatment, I authorize the Practice and its clinicians to initiate emergency protocols, contact emergency medical services (911), and share relevant medical information with emergency responders and healthcare facilities as necessary to protect my health and safety. I understand that any costs associated with emergency medical transport or treatment at an outside facility are my sole responsibility.

SCOPE OF PRACTICE & TEAM-BASED CARE: I understand that the Practice utilizes a team-based approach. Nurse Practitioners (NP): NPs are independent practitioners licensed to diagnose illness, prescribe medications, and initiate treatment plans under New York Education Law Section 6902. Registered Nurses (RN): RNs provide nursing care and execute medical regimens (such as IV infusions or injections) only under the specific order or standing order of a Nurse Practitioner or Physician. I understand that if my care is delivered by an RN, they are acting under the clinical direction of the Practice's NP. The RN does not independently diagnose medical conditions or prescribe treatments. Services provided are not a substitute for emergency medical care, primary care physician visits, or specialist consultations. The Practice does not assume the role of the patient's primary care provider.

DISPUTE RESOLUTION: Any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to this agreement or the services provided shall first be submitted to good faith mediation. If mediation is unsuccessful, disputes shall be resolved through binding arbitration administered in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association, with proceedings conducted in the State of New York. The prevailing party in any arbitration or legal proceeding shall be entitled to recover reasonable attorneys' fees and costs.

SEVERABILITY: If any provision of this consent is found to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, such finding shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions, which shall continue in full force and effect.

VOLUNTARY CONSENT: This consent is given pursuant to NY PHL Section 2805-d. I have the right to refuse or withdraw consent at any time without penalty. Both entities maintain professional malpractice insurance. I have been given the opportunity to ask questions and all my questions have been answered to my satisfaction. I have read, or have had read to me, this entire document. I understand its contents and I freely and voluntarily consent to the services described herein.

ACKNOWLEDGMENT: By signing below, I certify that I am at least 18 years of age (or the legal guardian of the patient), that I have the legal capacity to enter into this agreement, that I have read and fully understand all terms and conditions set forth herein, and that I voluntarily consent to treatment and agree to all terms of this Informed Consent.`;

SUBSTANCE USE & PATIENT SAFETY DISCLOSURE: I understand that honestly disclosing the use of all substancesâ€”including alcohol, marijuana/cannabis, nicotine, and recreational or illicit drugsâ€”is vital for my safety. Many substances can cause dangerous, life-threatening interactions with the medical treatments, IV therapies, and medications provided by the Practice (e.g., cardiac arrest, seizure, or respiratory failure).

The Practice agrees to notify me via email or text message at least 48 hours prior to charging my card for any post-service outstanding balance exceeding $50.00.

PRICING AND FEES: Service pricing is subject to change with 30 days advance notice. Custom compounded medications, specialty supplies, and additional materials may incur separate charges beyond the base service fee. Travel fees may apply for locations outside the standard service area. Emergency or after-hours service requests may be subject to additional surcharges.

CANCELLATION AND NO-SHOW POLICY: A minimum of 24 hours advance notice is required for appointment cancellations or rescheduling. Cancellations made less than 24 hours before the scheduled appointment are subject to a late cancellation fee of up to the full cost of the scheduled service. Failure to be present and available at the scheduled appointment time (no-show) is subject to a fee of up to the full cost of the scheduled service. Repeated late cancellations or no-shows (three or more within a 12-month period) may result in a required prepayment for future appointments or termination of the patient relationship.

PAST DUE ACCOUNTS AND COLLECTIONS: Balances remaining unpaid for 60 or more days may be referred to a third-party collections agency. In the event of collections action, the patient shall be responsible for all collection costs, including but not limited to collection agency fees, court costs, and reasonable attorneys' fees. Past due accounts may accrue interest at the maximum rate permitted by New York State law. The Practice reserves the right to decline future services until all outstanding balances are paid in full.
